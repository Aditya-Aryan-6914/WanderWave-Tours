# ShopMate — Simple E-commerce Frontpage

This is a minimal front-end scaffold of an e-commerce homepage (HTML/CSS/JS). It includes:

- A responsive header with navigation
- A hero sliding banner (automatic + controls) implemented in `js/main.js`
- A simple product grid and footer

To view locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser directly OR
2. Serve the folder with a simple HTTP server (recommended):

```bash
cd /workspaces/e-commerce
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Let me know if you want further styling changes or additions (e.g., category carousels, dropdown menus, or animations).
